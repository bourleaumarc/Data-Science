Factors Influencing Summer Olympics Performance - Analysis at a country and individual level.

The main purpose of our project is to discover:

- underlying factors that might directly or indirectly influence performance and success at the summer Olympics: at the national level and from an individual perspective.
  
- generate knowledge and learn more about the Olympics, which could allow us to make recommendations and predict country-wide or individual probability of success for all the events taking place at the summer Olympics.
